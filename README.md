The tradition I follow
Hey all! My name is Mehar Chawla. I couldn't give the JEE exam because my parents didn't want to send me away from my hometown for college and there is no point giving JEE like this because non of the good colleges exist in my hometown. In my country to become a really succesfull software engineer you either need to be really good at your profession i.e. software developing OR you need to be from a Tier-1 college. The 2nd option is closed for me now. This cannot stop me though. I will be THE BEST CODER that has ever set foot upon this beautiful planet....No kidding.
nothing describes my changes
